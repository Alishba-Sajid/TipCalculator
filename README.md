The tip calculator is a user-friendly tool designed to simplify the process of calculating the total bill per person after including a tip. Users can input the total bill amount, select their preferred tip percentage, and specify the number of people sharing the bill. The calculator then automatically computes the total cost, including the tip, and divides it evenly among all participants, providing a clear breakdown of each person's share. This ensures a hassle-free dining experience, allowing users to focus on enjoying their meal rather than worrying about the math.
